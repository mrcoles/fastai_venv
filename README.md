FastAI Venv
===========

A quick and easy way to setup a python venv for the [FastAI course](http://fast.ai).

Steps:

1. Clone the repo, optionally name it if you want your venv name to be different than fastai_venv: `git clone https://github.com/mrcoles/fastai_ven.git VENV_NAME`

2. Cd into the directory and run `bash setup_fastai.sh`

This will setup the venv *inside* the repo's directory. You can then activate the venv at any time with `. $PATH_TO_REPO/bin/activate`.
